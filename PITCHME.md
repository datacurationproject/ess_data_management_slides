### Data Management Plan

- Make data available and citeable
- Need metadata
- eg. technical metadata  (experimental setup, detector geometry
and area, phase Pulse width and shape, chopper configuration,
source type,  derived quantities, if raw or analyzed data,
energy resolution, calibration information, sample type
)
- descriptive metadata (date, investigator details, ORCID etc)
- administrative metadata (date, how created,
Digital object identifier or other persistent ID,
File type
)
